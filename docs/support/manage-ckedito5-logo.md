# Manage the "Powered by CKEditor 5" logo
<!-- This is a placeholder article -->
## Why the "Powered by CKEditor 5" logo?

Starting from version v38.0.0 onwards, all open-source installations of CKEditor (using it under the GPL terms) will carry a small “Powered by CKEditor” logo in the bottom right corner of the editing area. This new logo links directly to the [CKEditor website](https://ckeditor.com/) to strengthen the awareness of who is powering and modernizing their rich text editor.

This change does not affect customers with commercial licenses. You can reach out to our Technical Support team, using [this form](https://ckeditor.com/contact/), if you have any questions.
