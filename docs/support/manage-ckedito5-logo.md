## Why the "Powered by CKEditor" logo?

From version v38.0.0 onwards, all open source installations of CKEditor will carry a small “Powered by CKEditor” annotation in the bottom right corner of the editing area. This new tag links directly to the [CKEditor website](https://ckeditor.com/) and while it may be a little frustrating to some, it is designed to make sure the entire community knows who is powering and modernizing their rich text editor.

It is also another way for us to gather feedback from users and continue to improve this major open source project that we have been supporting for more than 20 years. CKEditor has 40+ full time engineers and R&D professionals focused on its continual evolution, with 30K+ developers now using it on a daily basis.

This change does not affect customers with commercial licenses. You can reach out to our Technical Support team, using [this form](https://ckeditor.com/contact/), if you have any questions.

## How to remove the "Powered by CKEditor" logo?

In order to remove the logo, you need a commercial license for CKEditor 5. If you need one, please [contact us](https://ckeditor.com/) for a tailored offer.

If you already have a commercial license, you need to configure the `config.LicenseKe` properly.
